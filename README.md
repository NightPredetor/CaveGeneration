# CaveGeneration
In this project a cave is generated through cellular automaton. A cellular automaton (CA) is a collection of cells arranged in a grid of specified shape, such that each cell changes state as a function of time, according to a defined set of rules driven by the states of neighboring cells.

# Logic
Each cell in the grid can be in either of one states - WALL or PATH.

Step 1 - Initialize a grid of cells. Randomly assign a state to the cell.<br>
Step 2 - Loop through the cells using the following logic and store the new cell state.
